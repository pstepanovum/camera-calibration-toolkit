# Data Directory

This directory contains input data for calibration experiments.

## Structure

- `checkerboard_images/`: Place checkerboard calibration images here
- `manual_experiments/`: Data collected for manual calibration experiments

## Checkerboard Images Guidelines

For optimal calibration results:

1. Capture 15-25 images of the checkerboard pattern
2. Vary the orientation and position in each image
3. Include images at different distances from the camera
4. Cover different regions of the image frame
5. Ensure the entire checkerboard is visible in each image
6. Use good lighting conditions
7. Avoid motion blur

## Manual Experiment Data

Document all measurements taken during manual calibration experiments:

- Object dimensions
- Camera-to-object distances
- Image measurements
- Environmental conditions
